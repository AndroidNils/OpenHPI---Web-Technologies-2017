# OpenHPI Web-Technologies-2017
This is my bonus task of the online course [Web-Technologies](https://open.hpi.de/courses/www) (2017). The task was to reprogram a website with HTML and CSS from a screenshot (I know the website is ugly, but this is what the screenshot looked like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

This project was developed in 2017.
